This is the second assessment project for the Udacity's [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

It requires the student to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The project I realised meets the [project specifications](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2658/view) required by Udacity and in particular:

- 4 sections have been added to the page
- styling has been added for active states
- the navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
- the section being viewed is highlighted while scrolling through the page
- when clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scroll to the appropriate section

Regarding the extra requirements, the following has been implemented:

- added an active state to the navigation items when a section is in the viewport
- hiding the navigation bar when scrolling

## Tech Stack:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node
- GIT
